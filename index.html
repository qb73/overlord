	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p>Welcome to a site dedicated to history. For this website, the concept introduces the invasion of Normand by the Allies against the Germans (and other Axis forces), on one of the greatest invasion orchestrated. The Allies had the concept prepared and began making moves to secure Normand, France, through five beaches. This invasion had been planned for months, and due to bad weather was constantly delayed. When the skies cleared in the evening of the previous day (June 5th), Paratrooper units were dropped behind enemy lines, and infantry divisions sailing for Normandy on the next, faithful day. June 6th, 1944.</p>
