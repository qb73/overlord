	<h2>Utah &amp; Omaha Beach</h2>
	<p>The first two United States' landing zones in the invasion of Normandy was conducted at 6:30 AM on June 6th, 1944. Codenamed Utah, and Omaha Beach respectively. Utah's landing zones were Tare, Green, Uncle Red, and Victor. Omaha's landings zones were Charlie, Dog, Easy, and Fox. Out of every beach on D-Day, is is estimed that Omaha Beach had the highest casualty rate when compared to any other beach &#40;~2,400 casualties&#41;. Utah, on the other hand, suffered the least amount of casualties than any other beach &#40;~197 casualties&#41;. Whilst Utah had a straight-forward obstacle, areas such as Pointe Du Hoc gave quite a challenge to be captured.</p>
